Dear MX:    Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for the programming apprenticeship.<br><br>

I am currently a Junior at Stevens-Henager College, working on my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.
 I have taken several classes in networking, computer servicing,
 and data bases and am starting to focus more on programming courses.<br><br>
 
I enjoy the industry and am excited for the opportunity to begin a career within computer technology.
 I feel that ongoing education is vital to grow and achieve greatness.
 I am motivated, hard working, eager to learn, and easy to get along with.
 I believe that an apprenticeship with MX would be a great way for me to develop my technical skills and gain valuable experience.
 My goal is to obtain a full time position with a reputable company like MX and work and grow with a team.<br><br>

Please look over my website. I’ve been focusing on JavaScript lately.
 I like to challenge my abilities and I don't stop until I am satisfied.
 In an additional course I’m taking online, it showed me how to make a code runner similar to Code Pen.<br>
 That was difficult, but very fun.<br><br>

 I appreciate you considering me for this position. My resume is attached. I look forward to a formal interview.<br><br>

 Sincerely,
 Brock Oberhansley<br><br>
